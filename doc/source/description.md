IPET (Interactive Performance Evaluation Tools) is a toolbox that
allows to easily create customized benchmark tables from
raw solver log files. It is aimed to develop evaluations through a
grapical interface that can later be loaded and reused on other
data. Additional readers and evaluations are stored in
xml-format which can be plugged in into the evaluation method.

Some visualizations are also provided.
