<!-- this reader file defines a reader that should read the depth of the first solution that was found.
    the line to be parsed looks like this:
    
    First Solution   : +3.29530000000000e+04   (in run 1, after 1 nodes, 0.38 seconds, depth 9363, found by <shiftandpropagate>)
    (index)
    1.) We specify the data key under which the parsed data should be stored for every instance in the test run.
    2.) The data type should be 'int' or 'float'
    3.) the index is the zero-based index of this number in the parsed line, i.e. 4 in the case of the depth.
    
    First Solution   : +3.29530000000000e+04   (in run 1, after 1 nodes, 0.38 seconds, depth 9363, found by <shiftandpropagate>)
    (index)            0                               1        2        3                   4
    
    4.) The reader has to have a meaningful name. If omitted, the data key is taken and extended by "Reader".
    5.) The regpattern should be a part of the line to recognize matches. Regular expressions can be used.
    6.) The method determines how multiple matches within one instance output should be treated. Either take the 'first' or 'last', 
        or use 'sum' to sum up the numbers.
